Describe: Pizza()

Test: "The function should create a new Pizza type object."
Code: 
const pizza1 = new Pizza();
typeof(pizz1);
Expected Output: 'object'

Test: "The function should take in an array of toppings, and a size varriable to set as two respective properties in the object, as well as initialize a third property, cost, and set it to 0."
Code:
const pizza1 = new Pizza(["onions", "cheese"], "small");
Expected Output: Pizza {cost: 0, toppings: ["onions", "cheese"], size: "small"}


Describe: Pizza.prototype.findCost()

Test: "If there are no toppings in the toppings object property, it should return just the cost of the pizza based on its size."
Code: 
const pizza1 = new Pizza([], "small");
pizza1.findCost();
Expected Output: 100

Test: "If there are toppings, their cost will be added to the cost of the size of the pizza and return the total cost."
Code:
const pizza1 = new Pizza(["onions", "cheese", "Beyond Blood (vegan)"], "small");
pizza1.findCost();
Expected Output:120


Describe: Order()

Test: "The function should create a new Order type object."
Code:
const order1 = new Order();
typeof(order1);
Expected Output: 'object'

Test: "The object should have properties for pizzas (an array of objects), and total (default set to 0)"
Code:
const order1 = new Order();
order1;
Expected Output:
Order {pizzas: Array(0), total: 0}
pizzas: []
total: 0
[[Prototype]]: Object


Describe: Order.prototype.addToOrder()
Before Each: 
const order1 = new Order();
const pizza1 = new Pizza(["onions", "cheese", "Beyond Blood (vegan)"], "small");

Test: "It should take in a pizza object as an argument and push it to the Order.pizzas array property."
Code:
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.pizzas;
Expected Output:
[Pizza]
0: Pizza {toppings: Array(3), size: 'small', cost: 0}
length: 1
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

Test: "It should be able to add multiple pizzas to one order"
Code:
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.pizzas;
Expected Output:
(3) [Pizza, Pizza, Pizza]
0: Pizza {toppings: Array(3), size: 'small', cost: 0}
1: Pizza {toppings: Array(3), size: 'small', cost: 0}
2: Pizza {toppings: Array(3), size: 'small', cost: 0}
length: 3
[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

Test: "It should add the cost of each pizza to the total property."
Code:
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.total;
Expected Output: 120

Test: "It should add multiple pizza costs together"
Code:
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.addToOrder(pizza1);
order1.pizzas;
Expected Output: 360
